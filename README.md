I am Andrea Ceriati, and this week I worked on the following assignments:

# PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

- Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote

- In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Repository

In this repository you can find one separate folder for each assignment.
In each folder you can find a Resources folder containg the csv file used for the analysis, an Analysis folder with a text file with the results of the analysis, and a python file with the python script.
